How to Presence server

0.a: This is an ubuntu server.
0.b: mySQL is installed.

You can copy this folder to the appropriate place in the the friendup filestructure
by running update_to_fup.sh, after adjusting the path defined in the script as necessary.

1: copy example.config.js to config.js

2: set database host, port, user, pass and name in config.js.
'user' can be a new user name, different from the mysql admin user name
or an existing user.

3: Feel free to set other relevant values in config.js while you are in there,
	but it is not critical to the install process.

4: TLS : set the proper paths in server.tls. Using FriendCores key and certificate
	should be fine: you can find them in friendup/cfg/crt

5: > bash install.sh
	bash, not sh.
	This will check for node and npm, install nodejs packages and set up the database/user

6: starting the server:
		> phoenix_presence.sh
	will start, and respawn the server if it crashes.
	It also writes to error.log and restart.log.
	To stop it, kill the phoenix_hello.sh process first, then the server.
	OR
	start the server directly with
		> node presence.js
	
	For starting from terminal and leaving it in the background, so it doesnt stop when
	the terminal is closed, use 'nohup <command> &' and hit enter a few times.
	feks:
		> nohup sh phoenix_hello.sh &
